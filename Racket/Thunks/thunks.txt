Delayed Evaluation/Thunks

-Functions are eager
	-Parameters are immedieatly evaluated
-Conditionals are not eager
	-Racket only evaluates the expression that is need

-If you want to delay an evaluation, wrap it in a function, and don't
call it until you need it
	-Thunks

-Thunks
	-Zero argument function used to delay evaluation
-Example:
	e
	(lambda() e) -Thunks
	(e) -Calling the thunk
