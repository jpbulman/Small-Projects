-Stream
	-An inifinite sequence of values
	-Can't actually make it
	-Can make something to represent it
	-Use a thunk to delay creating most of the sequences
	
	-Stream producer
		-Knows how to create any number of values
	-Stream consumer 
		-Decides how many values to create

	-Example of streams: 
		-User actions (mouse,keys,etc)
		-UNIX pipes

-Using Streams
	-Represent a stream as a thunk
	-When called, returns a pair
	
(first (powersoftwo))

(first ((rest (powersoftwo))))

-Rest of the thunk will produce a procedure, needs to be called
-Have to be careful if you are calling thunks/streams OR pairs
